              The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was
              born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records
              of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi.
              Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring
              and Autumn period and that he was active as a general and
              strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC,
              beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to
              write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of the most widely
              read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a
              time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi,
              Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who fought to control the vast expanse
              of fertile territory in Eastern China.

              This Collectable Hardbound Deluxe Edition is beautifully crafted
              and designed. Perfect for gifting as well as for keeps. A prized
              edition for any library. The art of war is of vital importance to
              the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to
              safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on
              no account be neglected. The Art of War is an enduring classic
              that holds a special place in the culture and history of East
              Asia. An ancient Chinese text on the philosophy and politics of
              warfare and military strategy, the treatise was written in 6th
              century B.C. by a warrior-philosopher now famous all over the
              world as Sun Tzu. Sun Tzu s teachings remain as relevant to
              leaders and strategists today as they were to rulers and military
              generals in ancient times. Divided into thirteen chapters and
              written succinctly, The Art of War is a must read for anybody who
              works in an competitive environment or who is interested in
              warfare, strategy and Chinese history.
